KRAS-NRAS-BRAF-PIK3CA-NGS
Illumina NGS data analysis for the RoI's of four genes that may contribute to EGFR inhibitor resistance.

These sripts analyse short read, next generation sequencing data for the genes generated from an Illumina Genome Analyser using the Qiagen "GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2 Human Tumor Actionable Mutations Panel" (Product no. 181900, Cat. no. NGHS-201X).  It should also work with data generated from an Illumina Genome Analyser using and any PCR primers that amplify the regions of interest.  Gene alignment and numbering is for human genome build hg19.

It generates three outputs:
1. csv files with the percentage reads for each nucleotide at each position.
2. pdf files of stacked bar charts showing the percentage of each nucleotide at each position.
3. A txt file containing any mutations detected.
