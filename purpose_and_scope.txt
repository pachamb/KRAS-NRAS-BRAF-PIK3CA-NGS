Purpose and scope of the code.

These sripts analyse short read, next generation sequencing data for BRAF, KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA genes generated from an Illumina Genome Analyser using the Qiagen "GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2 Human Tumor Actionable Mutations Panel" (Product no. 181900, Cat. no. NGHS-201X).  It should also work with data generated from an Illumina Genome Analyser using and any PCR primers that amplify the regions of interest.  Gene alignment and numbering is for human genome build hg19.

"ShortRead_quality_assessment.R" assesses the quality of the short NGS reads generated by an Illumina genome analyser.  It complements, rather than replaces the quality assessment performed on the analyser. 
"NGS_analysis_files+folders.R" reads in the aligned sequence files and creates names and locations of the reports.
The other scripts analyse data for the four genes.

It generates three outputs:
1. csv files with the percentage reads for each nucleotide at each position.
2. pdf files of stacked bar charts showing the percentage of each nucleotide at each position.
3. A txt file containing any mutations detected.
